Sometimes those fixes lead to even more bugs, leading to more changes in the code base. Data files get combined. Those same files are split and combined again. In just one research project, we can expect thousands of changes!\nThese changes are important to track, and yet, we often use simplistic file names to do so. Many of us have experienced renaming a document or script multiple times with the disingenuous addition of “final” to the file name.\nA better way: version control\nVersion control provides an organized and transparent way to track changes in code and files. This practice was designed for software development, but is easily applicable to scientific programming.\nBenefits to using a version control software include:\n\nMaintain a history of project development while keeping your workspace clean\nFacilitate collaboration and transparency when working on teams\nExplore bugs or new features without disrupting your team’s work\nand more!\n\nThe version control system we’ll be diving into is Git, the most widely used modern version control system in the world."

    "text": "2 Introduction to Git + GitHub\nLet’s start with a motivating example that’s representative of the types of problems Git can help us solve.\nFull Screen\n\n\nWith Git we can enhance our workflow:\n\nEliminate the need for cryptic filenames and comments to track our work.\nProvide detailed descriptions of our changes through commits, making it easier to understand the reasons behind code modifications.\nWork on multiple branches simultaneously, allowing for parallel development, and optionally merge them together.\nUse commits to access and even execute older versions of our code.\nAssign meaningful tags to specific versions of our code.\nMultiple individuals can work on the same analysis concurrently on their own computers, with the ability to merge everyone’s changes together.\n\n\n\n2.1 What exactly are Git and GitHub?\n\nGit: an open-source version control software\n\ndesigned to manage the versioning and tracking of files and project history\noperates locally on your computer, allowing you to create repositories and track changes\nprovides features such as committing changes, branching and merging code, reverting to previous versions, and managing project history\nworks directly with the files on your computer and does not require a network connection for most operations\nprimarily used through the command-line interface (CLI, e.g. Terminal), but also has various GUI tools available (e.g. RStudio IDE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub: an online platform and service built around Git\n\nprovides a centralized hosting platform for Git repositories\nallows us to store, manage, and collaborate on Git repositories in the cloud\noffers additional features on top of Git, including a web-based interface, issue tracking, project management tools, pull requests, code review, and collaboration features\nenables easy sharing of code with others, facilitating collaboration and contribution to open source projects\nprovides a social aspect, allowing users to follow projects, star repositories, and discover new code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 How local files, Git, and GitHub work together\nIt can be daunting to understand the moving parts of the Git / GitHub life cycle (i.e. how file changes are tracked locally within repositories, then stored for safe-keeping and collaboration on remote repositories, then brought back down to a local machine(s) for continued development). It gets easier with practice, but here’s a high-level overview of how things work:\n\n2.2.1 What is the difference between a “normal” folder vs. a Git repository?\nLet’s pretend that we create a folder, called myFolder/, and add two files: myData.csv and myAnalysis.R. The contents of this folder are not currently version-controlled – meaning, for example, that if we make changes to myAnalysis.R that don’t work out, we have no way of accessing or reverting back to a previous version of myAnalysis.R (without remembering or rewriting things, of course).\nGit allows you to turn any “normal” folder, like myFolder/, into a Git repository – this is often referenced as “initializing a Git repository”. When you initialize a folder on your local computer as a Git repository, a hidden .git/ folder is created within that folder (e.g. myFolder/.git/). This .git/ folder is the Git repository.\nAs you use Git commands to capture versions or “snapshots” of your work, those versions (and their associated metadata) get stored within the .git/ folder. This allows you to access and/or recover any previous versions of your work. If you delete .git/, you delete your project’s history.\nHere is our example folder / Git repository represented visually:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 How do I tell Git to preserve versions of my local working files?\nGit was built as a command-line tool, meaning we can use Git commands in the command line (e.g. Terminal, Git Bash, etc.) to take “snapshots” of our local working files. Alternatively, RStudio provides buttons that easily execute these Git commands.\nGenerally, that workflow looks something like this:\n\nMake changes to a file(s) (e.g. myAnalysis.R) in your working directory.\nStage the file(s) using git add myAnalysis.R (or git add . to stage multiple changed files at once). This lets Git know that you’d like to include the file(s) in your next commit.\nCommit the file(s) using git commit -m \"a message describing my changes\". This records those changes (along with a descriptive message) as a “snapshot” or version in the local repository (i.e. the .git/ folder).\n\n\n\n2.2.3 How do I send work from my local computer to GitHub?\nThe last step is synchronizing the changes made to our local repository with a remote repository (this remote repository is often stored on GitHub). The git push command is used to send local commits up to a remote repository. The git pull command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into the local repository – pulling will become a regular part of your workflow when collaborating with others, or even when working alone but on different machines (e.g. a laptop at home and a desktop at the office).\nA basic git workflow represented as two islands, one with “local repo” and “working directory”, and another with “remote repo.” Bunnies move file boxes from the working directory to the staging area, then with Commit move them to the local repo. Bunnies in rowboats move changes from the local repo to the remote repo (labeled “PUSH”) and from the remote repo to the working directory (labeled “PULL”).\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Let’s Look at a GitHub Repository\nThis screen shows the copy of a repository stored on GitHub, with its list of files, when the files and directories were last modified, and some information on who made the most recent changes.\n\n\n\nIf we drill into the “commits” for the repository, we can see the history of changes made to all of the files. Looks like kellijohnson was working on the project and fixing errors in December:\n\n\n\nAnd finally, if we drill into one of the changes made on December 20, we can see exactly what was changed in each file:\n\n\n\nTracking these changes, how they relate to released versions of software and files is exactly what Git and GitHub are good for. And we will show how they can really be effective for tracking versions of scientific code, figures, and manuscripts to accomplish a reproducible workflow.\n\n\n2.4 Git Vocabulary & Commands\nWe know the world of Git and GitHub can be daunting. Use these tables as references while you use Git and GitHub, and we encourage you to build upon this list as you become more comfortable with these tools.\nThis table contains essential terms and commands that complement intro to Git skills. They will get you far on personal and individual projects.\n\nEssential Git Commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nGit Command(s)\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nAdd/Stage\ngit add [file]\nStaging marks a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. You can also stage all modified files at the same time using git add .\n\n\nCommit\ngit commit\nRecords changes to the repository.\n\n\nCommit Message\ngit commit -m \"my commit message\"\nRecords changes to the repository and include a descriptive message (you should always include a commit message!).\n\n\nFetch\ngit fetch\nRetrieves changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into your local working file(s).\n\n\nPull\ngit pull\nRetrieves changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local working file(s).\n\n\nPush\ngit push\nSends local commits to a remote repository.\n\n\nStatus\ngit status\nShows the current status of the repository, including (un)staged files and branch information.\n\n\n\nThis table includes more advanced Git terms and commands that are commonly used in both individual and collaborative projects.\n\nAdvanced Git Commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nGit Command(s)\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nBranch\ngit branch\nLists existing branches or creates a new branch.\n\n\nCheckout\ngit checkout [branch]\nSwitches to a different branch or restores files from a specific commit.\n\n\nClone\ngit clone [repository]\nCreates a local copy of a remote repository.\n\n\nDiff\ngit diff\nShows differences between files, commits, or branches.\n\n\nFork\n-\nCreates a personal copy of a repository under your GitHub account for independent development.\n\n\nLog\ngit log\nDisplays the commit history of the repository.\n\n\nMerge\ngit merge [branch]\nIntegrates changes from one branch into another branch.\n\n\nMerge Conflict\n-\nOccurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches, requiring manual resolution.\n\n\nPull Request (PR)\n-\nA request to merge changes from a branch into another branch, typically in a collaborative project.\n\n\nRebase\ngit rebase\nIntegrates changes from one branch onto another by modifying commit history.\n\n\nRemote\ngit remote\nManages remote repositories linked to the local repository.\n\n\nRepository\ngit init\nA directory where Git tracks and manages files and their versions.\n\n\nStash\ngit stash\nTemporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed.\n\n\nTag\ngit tag\nAssigns a label or tag to a specific commit.\n\n\n\nGit has a rich set of commands and features, and there are many more terms beyond either table.

This is a common place to include any pertinent information about what your repository contains, how to use it, etc.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFor simple changes to text files, such as the README.md, you can make edits directly in the GitHub web interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteChallenge\n\n\n\nNavigate to the README.md file in the file listing, and edit it by clicking on the pencil icon (top right of file). This is a regular Markdown file, so you can add markdown text. Add a new level-2 header called “Purpose” and add some bullet points describing the purpose of the repo. When done, add a commit message, and hit the Commit changes button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations, you’ve now authored your first versioned commit! If you navigate back to the GitHub page for the repository, you’ll see your commit listed there, as well as the rendered README.md file.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GitHub repository landing page provides us with lots of useful information. To start, we see:\n\nall of the files in the remote repository\nwhen each file was last edited\nthe commit message that was included with each file’s most recent commit (which is why it’s important to write good, descriptive commit messages!)\n\nAdditionally, the header above the file listing shows the most recent commit, along with its commit message, and a unique ID (assigned by Git) called a SHA. The SHA (aka hash) identifies the specific changes made, when they were made, and by who. If you click on the SHA, it will display the set of changes made in that particular commit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionWhat should I write in my commit message?\n\n\n\nWriting effective Git commit messages is essential for creating a meaningful and helpful version history in your repository. It is crucial to avoid skipping commit messages or resorting to generic phrases like “Updates.” When it comes to following best practices, there are several guidelines to enhance the readability and maintainability of the codebase.\nHere are some guidelines for writing effective Git commit messages:\n\nBe descriptive and concise: Provide a clear and concise summary of the changes made in the commit. Aim to convey the purpose and impact of the commit in a few words.\nUse imperative tense: Write commit messages in the imperative tense, as if giving a command. For example, use “Add feature” instead of “Added feature” or “Adding feature.” This convention aligns with other Git commands and makes the messages more actionable.\nSeparate subject and body: Start with a subject line, followed by a blank line, and then provide a more detailed explanation in the body if necessary. The subject line should be a short, one-line summary, while the body can provide additional context, motivation, or details about the changes.\nLimit the subject line length: Keep the subject line within 50 characters or less. This ensures that the commit messages are easily scannable and fit well in tools like Git logs.\nCapitalize and punctuate properly: Begin the subject line with a capital letter and use proper punctuation. This adds clarity and consistency to the commit messages.\nFocus on the “what” and “why”: Explain what changes were made and why they were made. Understanding the motivation behind a commit helps future researchers and collaborators (including you!) comprehend its purpose.\nUse present tense for subject, past tense for body: Write the subject line in present tense as it represents the current state of the codebase. Use past tense in the body to describe what has been done.\nReference relevant issues: If the commit is related to a specific issue or task, include a reference to it. For example, you can mention the issue number or use keywords like “Fixes,” “Closes,” or “Resolves” followed by the issue number."

    "text": "4 Exercise 2: clone your repository and use Git locally in RStudio\nCurrently, our repository just exists on GitHub as a remote repository. It’s easy enough to make changes to things like our README.md file (as demonstrated above), from the web browser, but that becomes a lot harder (and discouraged) for scripts and other code files. In this exercise, we’ll bring a copy of this remote repository down to our local computer (aka clone this repository) so that we can work comfortably in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAn important distinction\n\n\n\nWe refer to the remote copy of the repository that is on GitHub as the origin repository (the one that we cloned from), and the copy on our local computer as the local repository.\n\n\nStart by clicking the green Code button (top right of your file listing) and copying the URL to your clipboard (this URL represents the repository location):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio makes working with Git and version controlled files easy – to do so, you’ll need to be working within an R project folder. The following steps will look similar to those you followed when first creating an R Project, with a slight difference. Follow the instructions in the Setup box below to clone your remote repository to your local computer in RStudio:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSetup\n\n\n\n\nClick File &gt; New Project\nSelect Version Control and paste the remote repository URL (which should be copied to your clipboard) in the Repository URL field\nPress Tab, which will auto-fill the Project directory name field with the same name as that of your remote repo – while you can name the local copy of the repository anything, it’s typical (and highly recommended) to use the same name as the GitHub repository to maintain the correspondence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you click Create Project, a new RStudio window will open with all of the files from the remote repository copied locally. Depending on how your version of RStudio is configured, the location and size of the panes may differ, but they should all be present – you should see a Git tab, as well as the Files tab, where you can view all of the files copied from the remote repo to this local repo.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll note that there is one new file sam_test.Rproj, and three files that we created earlier on GitHub (.gitignore, LICENSE, and README.md).\nIn the Git tab, you’ll note that the one new file, sam_test.Rproj, is listed. This Git tab is the status pane that shows the current modification status of all of the files in the repository. Here, we see sam_test.Rproj is preceded by a ?? symbol to indicate that the file is currently untracked by Git. This means that we have not yet committed this file using Git (i.e. Git knows nothing about the file; hang tight, we’ll commit this file soon so that it’s tracked by Git). As you make version control decisions in RStudio, these icons will change to reflect the current version status of each of the files.\nInspect the history. Click on the History button in the Git tab to show the log of changes that have occurred – these changes will be identical to what we viewed on GitHub. By clicking on each row of the history, you can see exactly what was added and changed in each of the two commits in this repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteChallenge\n\n\n\n\nMake a change to the README.md file – this time from RStudio – then commit the README.md change\nAdd a new section to your README.md called “Creator” using a level-2 header. Under it include some information about yourself. Bonus: Add some contact information and link your email using Markdown syntax.\n\n\n\nOnce you save, you’ll immediately see the README.md file show up in the Git tab, marked as a modification. Select the file in the Git tab, and click Diff to see the changes that you saved (but which are not yet committed to your local repository). Newly made changes are highlighted in green.\n\n\n\n\nCommit the changes. To commit the changes you made to the README.md file using RStudio’s GUI (Graphical User Interface), rather than the command line:\n\nStage (aka add) README.md by clicking the check box next to the file name – this tells Git which changes you want included in the commit and is analogous to using the git command, git add README.md, in the command line\nCommit README.md by clicking the Commit button and providing a descriptive commit message in the dialog box. Press the Commit button once you’re satisfied with your message. This is analogous to using the git command, git commit -m \"my commit message\", in the command line.\n\n\nA few notes about our local repository’s state:\n\nWe still have a file, sam_test.Rproj, that is listed as untracked (denoted by ?? in the Git tab).\nYou should see a message at the top of the Git tab that says, Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 1 commit., which tells us that we have 1 commit in the local repository, but that commit has not yet been pushed up to the origin repository (aka remote repository on GitHub).\n\nCommit the remaining project file by staging/adding and committing it with an informative commit message.\n\nWhen finished, you’ll see that no changes remain in the Git tab, and the repository is clean.\nInspect the history. Note that under Changes, the message now says:\nYour branch is ahead of ‘origin/main’ by 2 commits.\nThese are the two commits that we just made, but have not yet been pushed to GitHub.\nClick on the History button to see a total of four commits in the local repository (the two we made directly to GitHub via the web browser and the two we made in RStudio).\nPush these changes to GitHub. Now that we’ve made and committed changes locally, we can push those changes to GitHub using the Push button. This sends your changes to the remote repository (on GitHub) leaving your repository in a totally clean and synchronized state (meaning your local repository and remote repository should look the same).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIf you are prompted to provide your GitHub username and password when Pushing…\n\n\n\nit’s a good indicator that you did not set your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) correctly. You can redo the steps outlined in the GitHub Authentication section to (re)set your PAT, then Push again.\n\n\n\n &lt;––&gt;\n\nIf you look at the History pane again, you’ll notice that the labels next to the most recent commit indicate that both the local repository (HEAD) and the remote repository (origin/HEAD) are pointing at the same version in the history. If we look at the commit history on GitHub, all the commits will be shown there as well.\n\n\n\n4.1 Defining Merge Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSome Git configuration to surpress warning messages\n\n\n\nGit version 2.27 includes a new feature that allows users to specify the default method for integrating changes from a remote repository into a local repository, without receiving a warning (this warning is informative, but can get annoying). To suppress this warning for this repository only we need to configure Git by running this line of code in the Terminal:\n\ngit config pull.rebase false\n\npull.rebase false is a default strategy for pulling where Git will first try to auto-merge the files. If auto-merging is not possible, it will indicate a merge conflict (more on resolving merge conflicts in Collaborating with Git and GitHub).\nNote: Unlike when we first configured Git, we do not include the --global flag here (e.g. git config --global pull.rebase false). This sets this default strategy for this repository only (rather than globally for all your repositories). We do this because your chosen/default method of grabbing changes from a remote repository (e.g. pulling vs. rebasing) may change depending on collaborator/workflow preference."

    "text": "5 Exercise 3: Setting up Git on an existing project\nThere are a number of different workflows for creating version-controlled repositories that are stored on GitHub. We started with Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 using one common approach: creating a remote repository on GitHub first, then cloning that repository to your local computer (you used your {FIRSTNAME}_test repo).\nHowever, you may find yourself in the situation where you have an existing directory (i.e. a “normal” folder) of code that you want to make a Git repository out of, and then send it to GitHub. In this last exercise, we will practice this workflow using your training_{USERNAME} project.\nFirst, switch to your training_{USERNAME} project using the RStudio project dropdown menu. The project drop down menu is in the upper right corner of your RStudio pane. Click the drop down next to your project name ({FIRSTNAME}_test), and then select the training_{USERNAME} project from the RECENT PROJECTS list.\nThere are a few approaches for turning an existing project folder into a Git repository, then sending it to GitHub – if you’re an R-user, the simplest way is to use the {usethis} package, which is built to automate tasks involved with project setup and development. However, you can also initialize a local git repository and set the remote repository from the command line (a language-agnostic workflow). Steps for both approaches are included below (demonstrated using your training_{USERNAME} project):\n\nUsing R & {usethis}Using the command line\n\n\n\nInstall the {usethis} package (if you haven’t done so already) by running the following in your Console:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n\n\nInitialize training_{USERNAME} as a Git repository by running usethis::use_git() in the Console. Choose yes when asked if it’s okay to commit any uncommitted files. Choose yes again if asked to restart R. Once complete, you should see the Git tab appear in your top left pane in RStudio and a .gitignore file appear in your Files tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote.gitignore files allow you to specify which files/folders you don’t want Git to track\n\n\n\nA .gitignore file is automatically created in the root directory of your project when you initialize it as a Git repository. You’ll notice that there are already some R / R Project-specific files that have been added by default.\nWhy is this useful? For many reasons, but possibly the greatest use-case is adding large files (GitHub has a file size limit of 2 GB) or files with sensitive information (e.g. keys, tokens) that you don’t want to accidentally push to GitHub.\nHow do I do this? Let’s say I create a file with sensitive information that I don’t want to push to GitHub. I can add a line to my .gitignore file:\n\n# added by default when I initalized my RProj as a Git Repository\n.Rproj.user\n.Rhistory\n.Rdata\n.httr-oauth\n.DS_Store\n.quarto\n\n# add file so that it doesn't get pushed to the remote repo (on GitHub); \ncontains_sensitive_info.R\n\nIf this file is currently untracked by Git, it should appear in my Git tab. Once I add it to the .gitignore and save the modified .gitignore file, you should see contains_sensitive_info.R disappear from the Git tab, and a modified .gitignore (denoted by a blue M) appear. Stage/commit/push this modified .gitignore file.\n\n\n\nCreate an upstream remote repository on GitHub by running usethis::use_github() in the Console. Your web browser should open up to your new GitHub repository, with the same name as your local Git repo/R Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that your default branch is named main rather than master by:\n\nrunning git branch in the Terminal to list all your branches (you should currently only have one, which is your default)\nif it’s named master, run the following line in the Console to update it\n\n\n\nusethis::git_default_branch_rename(from = \"master\", to = \"main\")\n\nYou can verify that your update worked by running git branch once more in the Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy are we doing this?\n\n\n\nThe racist “master” terminology for git branches motivates us to update our default branch to “main” instead.\nThere is a push across platforms and software to update this historical default branch name from master to main. GitHub has already done so – you may have noticed that creating a remote repository first (like we did in Exercises 1 & 2) results in a default branch named main. Depending on your version of Git, however, you may need to set update the name manually when creating a local git repository first (as we’re doing here).\n\n\n\nYou’re now ready to edit, stage/add, commit, and push files to GitHub as practiced earlier!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: add a README.md file to training_{USERNAME}\n\n\n\nGitHub provides a button on your repo’s landing page for quickly adding a README.md file. Click the Add a README button and use markdown syntax to create a README.md. Commit the changes to your repository.\nGo to your local repository (in RStudio) and pull the changes you made.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we’ll be using the RStudio Terminal here, you can use any command-line interface (e.g. Mac Terminal, Git Bash, etc.) that allows for git interactions (if you plan to use a command-line interface that is not the RStudio Terminal, make sure to navigate to your project directory (e.g. using cd file/path/to/project/directory) before initializing your repository.\n\nInitialize training_{USERNAME} as a Git repository by running git init in the Terminal. You should get a message that says something like:\n\n\nInitialized empty Git repository in /home/username/training_username/.git/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantYou may have to quit and reopen your RStudio session on the server for the Git tab to appear\n\n\n\nYou’ll likely need to help included-crab along in recognizing that this R Project has been initialized as a git repository – click Session &gt; Quit Session… &gt; New Session &gt; choose training_{USERNAME} to reopen your project.\n\n\nOnce complete, you should see the Git tab appear in your top left pane in RStudio and a .gitignore file appear in your Files tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote.gitignore files allow you to specify which files/folders you don’t want Git to track\n\n\n\nA .gitignore file is automatically created in the root directory of your project when you initialize it as a Git repository.

Once I add it to the .gitignore and save the modified .gitignore file, you should see contains_sensitive_info.R disappear from the Git tab, and a modified .gitignore (denoted by a blue M) appear. Stage/commit/push this modified .gitignore file.\n\n\n\nEnsure that your default branch is named main rather than master by:\n\nrunning git branch in the Terminal to list all your branches (you should currently only have one, which is your default)\nif it’s named master, run the following line in the Terminal to update it\n\n\n\n# for Git version 2.28+ (check by running `git --version`)\n# this sets the default branch name to `main` for any new repos moving forward\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch main\n\n# for older versions of Git\n# this sets the default branch name to `main` ONLY for this repo \ngit branch -m master main\n\nYou can verify that your update worked by running git branch once more in the Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy are we doing this?\n\n\n\nThe racist “master” terminology for git branches motivates us to update our default branch to “main” instead.\nThere is a push across platforms and software to update this historical default branch name from master to main. GitHub has already done so – you may have noticed that creating a remote repository first (like we did in Exercises 1 & 2) results in a default branch named main. Depending on your version of Git, however, you may need to set update the name manually when creating a local git repository first (as we’re doing here).\n\n\n\nStage/Add your files. It’s helpful to first run git status to check the state of your local repository (particularly if you aren’t using RStudio / have access to a GUI with a Git tab-esque feature) – this will tell you which files have been modified or are untracked and that are currently unstaged (in red). What appears here should look just like what appears in the Git tab:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun git add . in the Terminal to stage all files at once (or git add {FILENAME} to stage individual files). Running git status again will show you which files have been staged (in green). You may have to refresh your Git tab to see the change in state reflected in the GUI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit your files by running git commit -m \"an informative commit message\" in the Terminal. Refreshing your Git tab will cause them to disappear (just as they do when you commit using RStudio’s GUI buttons). You can run git log in the Terminal to see a history of your past commits (currently, we only have this one).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an empty remote repository by logging into GitHub and creating a new repository, following the same steps as in Exercise 1. IMPORTANTLY, DO NOT initialize your remote repo with a README license, or .gitignore file – doing so now can lead to merge conflicts. We can add them after our local and remote repos are linked. Name your remote repository the same as your local repository (i.e. training_{USERNAME}).\nLink your remote (GitHub) repository to your local Git repository. Your empty GitHub repo conveniently includes instructions for doing so. Copy the code under push an existing repository from the command line to your clipboard, paste into your RStudio Terminal, and press return/enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese commands do three things:\n\nAdds the GitHub repository as the remote repository (i.e. links your local repo to the remote repo)\nRenames the default branch to main\nPushes the main branch to the remote GitHub repository\n\nHead back to your browser and refresh your GitHub repository page to see your files appear!\n\nYou’re now ready to edit, stage/add, commit, and push files to GitHub as practiced earlier!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: add a README.md file to training_{USERNAME}\n\n\n\nGitHub provides a button on your repo’s landing page for quickly adding a README.md file. Click the Add a README button and use markdown syntax to create a README.md. Commit the changes to your repository.\nGo to your local repository (in RStudio) and pull the changes you made."

Are you going back and forth between multiple software tools like Microsoft Excel, R, and Google Docs?

    "text": "3 Moving in an R Project using Paths & Working Directories\n\nNow that we have a project created (we know it’s an R Project because we see a .Rproj file in our Files pane), we can move files within that project. We do this using paths.\nThere are two types of paths in computing: absolute paths and relative paths.\n\nAbsolute paths always starts with the root of your file system and locates files from there. The absolute path to my project directory is: /home/lopazanski/github/training_lopazanski\nRelative paths start from some location in your file system that is below the root. Relative paths are combined with the path of that location to locate files on your system. R (and some other languages like MATLAB) refer to the location where the relative path starts as our working directory.\n\nRStudio projects automatically set the working directory to the directory of the project. This means that you can reference files from within the project without worrying about where the project directory itself is. If I want to read in a file from the data directory within my project, I can simply type read.csv(\"data/samples.csv\") as opposed to read.csv(\"/home/lopazanski/github/training_lopazanski/data/samples.csv\").\nThis is not only convenient for you, but also when working collaboratively. We will talk more about this later, but if Joe makes a copy of my R project that I have published on GitHub, and I am using relative paths, he can run my code exactly as I have written it, without going back and changing /home/lopazanski/github/training_lopazanski/data/samples.csv to /home/morton/github/training_morton/data/samples.csv.\nNote that once you start working in projects you should basically never need to run the setwd() command. If you are in the habit of doing this, stop and take a look at where and why you do it. Could Leveraging the working directory concept of R projects could likely eliminate this need.\nSimilarly, think about how you work with absolute paths. You could likely leverage the working directory of your R project to replace these with relative paths and make your code more portable.",

    "text": "1 Welcome to R Programming\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst\n\n\nIncorporating programming into analysis workflows makes science more efficient and more computationally reproducible. We will use the programming language R, and the accompanying integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio. R is a great language to learn for data-oriented programming because it is widely adopted, user-friendly, and (most importantly) open source.\n\n1.1 What is the difference between R and RStudio?\nImagine you are a chef, and you have to prepare a meal. You’ll need a place to work (a kitchen), you’ll need some tools (pots, pans, a knife, etc.), and you’ll need some ingredients. In this analogy, R is a good chef’s knife - one of the most important tools that you’ll use to accomplish your task.\nAnd if R is your chef’s knife, RStudio is your kitchen. RStudio provides a place to do your work! RStudio makes working with R easier by bringing together other tools for working efficiently - like a file browser, data viewer, help pages, terminal, support, etc. You could learn R without RStudio,\n(and in this analogy, your ingredients are data!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningR without RStudio?\n\n\n\nJust as you can prepare food without a kitchen, we could learn R without RStudio. RStudio makes it much easier to work with R, just as a well-stocked kitchen makes cooking more fun. We are going to take advantage of the great RStudio support, and learn R and RStudio in conjunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNew to coding? New to R? No worries!\n\n\n\nLearning R is like learning any new language. It’s an ongoing process, it takes time, you’ll make mistakes, it can be frustrating, but it will be overwhelmingly useful in the long run. We all speak at least one language - no matter how fluent you are, you’ll always be learning, you’ll be trying things in new contexts, learning new words and new phrases.\nYou’ll learn to understand context for programming language just like you learn the context for spoken language. Think about how every language often has a word for the first meal of the day – breakfast in English, desayuno in Spanish. Programming languages also have words (functions) that express specific ideas. There is a way to sort values, search for text patterns, calculate medians, or reshape data. The goal is to expand your expectations so that each goal that you have, there’s likely a function that helps you get there.",

    "text": "2 Using R within the RStudio IDE\nLet’s take a tour of the RStudio interface.\nFull Screen\n\n\n2.1 Objects in R\nLet’s say the value of 12 that we got from running 3 * 4 is a really important value we need to keep. To store information in R, we need to create an object.\nWe can assign a value or expression to an object using the assignment operator, &lt;- (greater than sign and minus sign). All objects in R are created using the assignment operator, following this form: object_name &lt;- value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExerciseExercise 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an object!\nAssign your favorite number to an object called fave_num. Then, create an object called fave_squared and assign the square of fave_num (use the superscript, like 5^2), and inspect the object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswerAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### think of this code as someone saying \"fave_num gets 42\".\nfave_num &lt;- 42\n\n### and then square it\nfave_squared &lt;- fave_num^2\nfave_squared\n\n[1] 1764\n\n\nNotice how after creating the fave_num object, R doesn’t print anything. However, we know our code worked because we see the object, and the value we wanted to store is now visible in our Global Environment. We can force R to print the value of the object by calling the object name (aka typing it out) or by using parentheses.\n\n### printing the object by calling the object name\nfave_squared\n\n[1] 1764\n\n### printing the object by wrapping the assignment syntax in parentheses\n(fave_squared &lt;- fave_num^2)\n\n[1] 1764\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipQuick navigation in the console\n\n\n\nWhen you begin typing, RStudio will suggest autocompletions that you can select by hitting tab, then return.\nIn the Console, use the up and down arrow keys to call your command history, which shows the most recent commands first.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Naming Things\nWhen naming objects, variables, observations, or data frames, make them:\n\nMeaningful\n\nPick names that are specific to the data, experiment, or project. Their interpretation should be intuitive - they shouldn’t be so generic or vague that the user needs a glossary to know what they contain.\nBad Examples: File-1.xlsx, indicator1, indicator2, ExperimentA.R, ExperimentB.R\nBetter Examples: taco_nutrients.csv, nc_demographics, mice_1a_mass, rachel_carson_spatial.shp\n\nConsistent\n\nKeep names perfectly identical for identical value entries (e.g. “burrito-32” and “Burrito 32” are completely different things to R)\nBe consistent across data frames. Your life will be easier if you have year called “year” in both sets, instead of “Year” and “YEAR” and “Year_New”.\nUse logical suffixes (if necessary), consistently formatted. Like: temp_water_surface, temp_water_sub, temp_water_bottom\n\nConcise\n\nBalance meaningfulness with conciseness\nBetter to be descriptive than not know what a variable is (especially with tab completion)\nLonger names = tedious coding, but less effort to look through metadata for column/identifier names (or risk of mis-remembering…)\nBad examples: ‘first dive temp readings Celsius’, greatblueheron_observations_2019_09_20, “Cori final figures version 3.xlsx”\nBetter examples: beaufort_sst, UsTotalPop, PercCover\n\nCode and coder-friendly\n\nAvoid punctuation (%, !, ~, (, ), #) in names - more challenging to type and can mean things in code that you don’t want it to (or break it)\nAvoid spaces (makes coding much more difficult\nAvoid starting object names with numbers (but could be useful for file names in sequence)\nPick and be consistent with a choice of case\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Case conventions\nA clear, consistent naming convention improves readability and reduces cognitive load. Choosing one is a personal preference.\nFor the object fave_num, we used an underscore to separate the object name. This naming convention is called lowercase snake case - it is common in data science because it’s easy to scan, works well across operating systems, and avoids ambiguity.\n\nsnake_case\ncamelCase is compact but less readable\nUpperCamelCase (also called PascalCase) sometimes signals a different kind of object\nkebab-case is not good for object names because R treats a hyphen (-) as a minus sign",

It’s long because the function has many optional arguments, but the key one is the first: you need to tell R which file to read. Let’s get a file!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDownload a file from the Arctic Data Center\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to this dataset by Craig Tweedie that is published on the Arctic Data Center. Craig Tweedie. 2009. North Pole Environmental Observatory Bottle Chemistry. Arctic Data Center. doi:10.18739/A25T3FZ8X.\nDownload BGchem2008data.csv by clicking the “download” button next to the file (cloud + arrow). Save it in a folder called data in the project.\nConfirm the file is in data by checking the Files pane.\n\n\n\nNow tell read.csv() where to find the file. The Help page shows the file argument, which takes a path. In R, you can either use absolute paths (which will start with your home directory ~/) or paths relative to your current working directory. RStudio has some great auto-complete capabilities when using relative paths, so we will go that route.\nIf your working directory is your project (training_{NAME}) and the CSV is in data, your import looks like this:\n\n# reading in data using relative paths\nbg_chem_dat &lt;- read.csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")\n\nThis creates a data frame called bg_chem_dat. Check that it loaded by looking in the environment pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipOptional Arguments\n\n\n\nThe Help page for read.csv() lists many arguments we didn’t use. Some are optional; some are required. Optional arguments appear as name = value, where the value shown is the default. If you don’t specify that argument, the function uses the default. For read.csv(), header = TRUE is a typical example.\nRequired arguments appear without a value. For read.csv(), the only required argument is file.\n\n\nR can match arguments by name or by position. In our earlier call, we didn’t specify file = because file is the first argument, and R assigns the first value to it automatically. The equivalent explicit call would be:\n\nbg_chem_dat &lt;- read.csv(file = \"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")\n\nTo adjust another argument, we need to name it, because the second argument in read.csv() is header. For example, many people set stringsAsFactors like this:\n\n# relative file path\nbg_chem_dat &lt;- read.csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipQuick Tip\n\n\n\nWith familiar functions, it’s common to omit names for the first one or two arguments. For less familiar functions, naming every argument makes your code more readable for collaborators and your future self.\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Working with data frames in R\nA data.frame stores tabular data: columns represent variables, and rows represent observations. When you used read.csv(), the result was a data.frame saved as bg_chem_dat. Explore it a few ways:\n\nClick on bg_chem_dat in the environment pane\nClick on the arrow next to bg_chem_dat in the environment pane\nRun head(bg_chem_dat) in the Console\nRun View(bg_chem_dat) in the Console\n\nNow examine specific columns and try a few simple calculations:\n\nhead(bg_chem_dat$Date)\n\nmean_temp &lt;- mean(bg_chem_dat$CTD_Temperature)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipOther ways to load tablular data\n\n\n\nBase R’s read.csv() is common, but many workflows use other import functions that also produce data frames:\n\nreadr::read_csv() from the handles csv files quickly and parses types (including dates) more reliably. (try: bg_chem_dat &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\"))\nreadxl::read_excel() reads Excel files.\ngooglesheets4::read_sheet() reads directly from Google Sheets.",

    "text": "8 Error messages are your friends\n\n\n\n\nProgramming comes with an implicit contract: the computer handles the tedious work, and you provide precise instructions. Typos and capitalization matter, and small differences can change the meaning entirely. Treat R as a language… misunderstandings will happen.\nWhen R can’t interpret what you’ve written, you’ll get an error. Some errors are straightforward, essentially asking “What?” or pointing to exactly where the problem is. Others are less helpful. Either way, they’re part of the process and a normal part of learning to communicate clearly with the computer.\n\n\nError messages are a learning opportunity. Copy and paste them into Google (or ChatGPT) to see what they mean. Note that knowing how to Google is a skill and takes practice. This Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program workshop Teach Me How to Google has a very helpful guide.\nSome mistakes don’t trigger errors right away. R may understand what you wrote, but not what you intended… much like talking about “tables” and realizing too late that the listener was picturing furniture instead of data. These misunderstandings accumulate and make later results confusing. Writing clear code and checking your work step by step helps prevent these silent errors and keeps your analysis on track.",

Each package contains a set of related functions that enable you to more easily do a task or set of tasks in R. There are thousands of community-maintained packages out there for just about every imaginable use of R - including many that you have probably never thought of!\nTo install a package, we use the syntax install.packages(\"packge_name\"). A package only needs to be installed once, so this code can be run directly in the console if needed. Generally, you don’t want to save your install package calls in a script, because when you run the script it will re-install the package, which you only need to do once, or if you need to update the package.",

There are a few useful commands for getting information about your Environment, which make it easier for you to reference your objects when your Environment gets filled with many, many objects.\n\nYou can get a listing of these objects with a couple of different R functions:\n\nobjects()\n\n [1] \"fave_num\"      \"fave_squared\"  \"m_to_ft\"       \"mean_height_m\"\n [5] \"mean_temp_c\"   \"mtcars\"        \"science_rocks\" \"temp_c\"       \n [9] \"tree_h_ft\"     \"tree_h_m\"      \"x\"             \"y\"            \n[13] \"z\"            \n\nls()\n\n [1] \"fave_num\"      \"fave_squared\"  \"m_to_ft\"       \"mean_height_m\"\n [5] \"mean_temp_c\"   \"mtcars\"        \"science_rocks\" \"temp_c\"       \n [9] \"tree_h_ft\"     \"tree_h_m\"      \"x\"             \"y\"            \n[13] \"z\"            \n\n\nIf you want to remove the object named tree_h_m, you can do this:\n\nrm(tree_h_m)\n\nTo remove everything (or click the Broom icon in the Environment pane):\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\n\n11.0.1 Quick Tip\nIt’s good practice to clear your environment. Over time your Global Environmental will fill up with many objects, and this can result in unexpected errors or objects being overridden with unexpected values.

    "text": "12 Save Workspace Image to .RData?\n\nDON’T SAVE\nWhen ever you close or switch projects you will be promped with the question: Do you want to save your workspace image to /“current-project”/ .RData?\nRStudio by default wants to save the state of your environment (the objects you have in your environment pane) into the RData file so that when you open the project again you have the same environment. However, as we discussed above, it is good practice to constantly clear and clean your environment. It is generally NOT a good practice to rely on the state of your environment for your script to run and work. If you are coding reproducibly, your code should be able to reproduce the state of your environment (all the necessary objects) every time you run it. It is much better to rely on your code recreating the environment than saving the workspace status.\nTo make sure you’re always working reproducibly, change the Global Options configuration for the default to be NEVER SAVE MY WORKSPACE. Go to Tools &gt; Global Options. Under the General menu, select Never next to “Save workspace to .RData on exit” (and uncheck “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”). This way you won’t get asked every time you close a project, instead RStudio knows not to save.\n :::::::::::::::::::::::::::",
