Let's take a tour of the RStudio interface!

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

##  {#rstudio-ide2 data-menu-title="RStudio IDE2"}

[RStudio IDE interface]{.slide-title}

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/rstudio_IDE.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="40%"}

::::: {.body-text}

Notice the default panes:

-   Console (entire left)
-   Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
-   Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)

**NOTE:** New tabs may show up in different contexts (e.g., Git tab)

:::::

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

::: {.body-text}
**Quick Tip:** You can change the default location of the panes, among many other things. More information [here](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-the-RStudio-IDE).

##  {#rstudio-console data-menu-title="RStudio Console"}

[RStudio IDE interface]{.slide-title}

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/rstudio_ide_console.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="40%"}

::::: {.body-text}

**Console** is where you can directly type R code.  

When you start a new session, you'll see some text that includes the current version of R software installed (yours may not match the image).

:::::

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

:::{.body-text}
There are tabs for **Terminal** and **Background Jobs**.  **Terminal** is direct access to your computer's operating system (not R software).

##  {#rstudio-envir data-menu-title="RStudio Environment"}

[RStudio IDE interface]{.slide-title}

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/rstudio_ide_envir.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="40%"}

::::: {.body-text}

**Environment** displays information in working memory - "objects" that may be individual values, lists or vectors with multiple values, data frames of tabular data, etc.

When you start a new session, the environment pane should say "Environment is empty." As you use R to make calculations and store values, you will see objects in this pane.
:::::

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

:::{.body-text}
There is a tab for **History** and perhaps others.  **History** will show you the sequence of any commands you have typed or executed into R.  When writing **R scripts**, the History tab is not necessary for reproducible science.

##  {#rstudio-files data-menu-title="RStudio Files"}

[RStudio IDE interface]{.slide-title}

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/rstudio_ide_files.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="40%"}

::::: {.body-text}

**Files** displays files and folders on your computer. You can navigate just like you would normally browse on your computer.

:::::

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

:::{.body-text}
Note the other tabs in this pane: when you create plots or tables, they will generate in the *plots* pane. *Packages* provides information on the packages and versions installed, and *Help* is provides searchable documentation for those packages and functions. *Viewer* and *Presentation* display HTML or other outputs.

[Coding in the Console]{.slide-title}

:::{.body-text}
We run code in the Console. 

At its most basic, we can use R as a calculator.  

Let's try a couple of examples in the console.

:::

```{r}
3 * 4
3 + 4
3 - 4
3 / 4
```

:::{.body-text}
When you hit "enter" after the calculation, R immediately evaluates the expression and provides the result.
:::

[Coding in the Console]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.callout-caution icon="false"}
#### Quick Tip

In the console, a greater than sign (`>`) signals the start of a line. This is called the "prompt" and means R is ready to accept commands. If you see a plus sign (`+`) in the console, it means R is waiting for additional information. You can press escape (`esc`) to return to the prompt. Try practicing this by running `3*` (or any incomplete expression).

## {#example-code-slide data-menu-title="Example Code"}

[Storing values in objects]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.body-text}
The assignment operator (`<-`) creates an "object" by assigning it a name. R will evaluate the expression on the right side, and store that value with the name on the left.

For example, assign the result of `3 * 4` and call it "result". Then we can call the *name* of the object to use the *value* in other calculations, and so on.

:::

```{r}
result <- 3 * 4   ### assign the value

result            ### retrieve the value
```


---

[Storing values in objects]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.body-text}
Here's a slightly more complicated example to calculate the volume of a cylinder.
:::
```{r}
r <- 5            ### radius of cylinder is 5 units
area <- pi * r^2  ### calculate the area, using r

area              ### report the area

h <- 7            ### height of cylinder is 7 units
vol <- area * h   ### volume is area X height

vol               ### report the volume
```

##  {#rstudio-envir2 data-menu-title="RStudio Environment2"}

[RStudio IDE interface]{.slide-title}

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="60%"}

![](images/rstudio_ide_envir2.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="40%"}

::::: {.body-text}

Now the **Environment** pane contains the objects and values we created in our example.
:::::

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

[R scripts vs. console]{.slide-title}

<hr>

::: {.body-text}
While there are many cases where it makes sense to type code directly in to the the console, it is not a great place to write most of your code since you can't save what you ran. 
:::

**A better way is to create an R Script, and write your code there.** 

::: {.body-text}
When you run your code from the script, you can save it when you are done, and you can re-run it later to get the exact same result - a key to  **reproducible science**.
