[Creating an R script]{.slide-title}

:::::: columns

<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="40%"}
::: body-text
From the "File" menu, select "New File," then choose "R Script."

You can also create the script from the "new file" button in the **Files** pane.

A new pane appears. This is the **Source** pane, where we write and edit code and documents. This pane is only present if there are files open in the editor.
:::
::::

<!-- end right column -->
::::::

<!-- end .columns -->

::: body-text
Save the R Script in your `script` folder, name the file `intro_to_programming.R`. The name at the top of the **Source pane** will change from `Untitled` to the new file name.

[A simple script]{.slide-title}

::: body-text
Let's write some simple code in our script. We'll start with the age of a dog in (human) years, then convert to dog years.
:::

```{r}
age_years <- 5

age_dog_years <- age_years * 7
```

::: body-text
The script editor doesn’t execute code automatically, so nothing appears in the **Environment** until you send lines to the Console. To run code, place the cursor on a line (or highlight several) and press `command` + `enter` (Mac) or `control` + `enter` (Windows), or click the green `Run` button in the top right of the Source pane. These shortcuts are worth practicing because you’ll use them constantly.

### Writing human-readable comments
:::

::: body-text
Scripts also let you document your work. Lines starting with `#` are comments, which R ignores, so you can add brief explanations or notes.

Commenting is also useful for temporarily disabling code. Use `command+shift+C` to toggle comments on selected lines.
:::

```{r}
### age in human years
age_years <- 5  ### can also put comments on the same line as code

### age in dog years
age_dog_years <- age_years * 7

### this line is commented out so will not run:
# age_centuries <- age_years / 100 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Multiple values]{.slide-title}

::: body-text
You can store multiple values in a single object. For example, a vector of ages lets you apply the same operation to all values at once. You create a vector with `c()`, which *combines* the values into one object.
:::

```{r}
age_yrs <- c(5, 3, 7)  ### create a vector of ages

yr_to_dog_yr <- 7      ### save the conversion factor as an object

### convert `age_yrs` to dog years:
age_dog_yrs <- age_yrs * yr_to_dog_yr 

### inspect the values
age_dog_yrs
```

#### Quick Tips

You’ll assign objects frequently, and typing `<-` each time is slow. Use RStudio’s shortcut: `option + minus` (Mac), `alt + minus` (Windows). The shortcut also inserts spaces around <-, which makes assignments easier to read. Consistent spacing improves clarity and reduces strain when scanning code.

RStudio offers many handy [keyboard shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts). Also, `option`+`Shift`+`K` brings up a keyboard shortcut reference card.
