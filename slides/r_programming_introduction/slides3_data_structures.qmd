[Common data types in R]{.slide-title}

::: {.body-text}
A single data value in R usually falls into one of a few basic classes:

* `logical`: `TRUE` or `FALSE`
* `integer`: whole numbers (e.g., `1`, `2`, `-999`) - add L to specify the type explicitly (e.g. `x <- 2L`)
* `numeric` (also called `double`): real numbers with decimals (e.g., `0.001`, `1.0`, `-273.16`)
* `character`: text or enclosed in quotes (e.g., `"cat"`, `"I like bananas"`, or `"Everest is 8848.9 m tall"`); character strings are words, sentences, or paragraphs.
* `factor`: characteris with defined levels or orders (e.g., `low`, `medium`, `high` might be converted to a factor by setting their order)

Any class can include `NA` to represent missing values.

[Common data types in R]{.slide-title}

::: {.callout-tip}
### Quick Tip
:::

:::{.body-text}
Check the class of a given object using `class()`, or with a logical test such as: `is.numeric()`, `is.character()`, `is.logical()`, etc.

:::

```{r}
science_rocks <- "yes it does!"
class(science_rocks)
is.numeric(science_rocks)
is.character(science_rocks)
```

---

[Data structures in R]{.slide-title}

::: {.body-text}

When you work with multiple values, you need structures that store data in an organized way. R uses several core structures for this purpose: vectors, matrices, arrays, data frames, and lists. Each holds collections of values in a defined shape and is suited to different types of operations.

[Data structures in R: vectors]{.slide-title}

A **vector** contains one or more elements of the same data type

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="30%"}

![](images/data_structures_vector.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="70%"}

::::: {.body-text}
* Our `age_yrs` object was a vector of three elements, all `numeric` data type.
* Create a vector using the `c()` function ("combine"):
:::::


```{r}
age_yrs = c(5, 3, 7)
```

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

---

[Data structures in R: vectors]{.slide-title}

:::{.body-text}
Each vector can contain only one data type/class.  If you try to combine classes, R will "coerce" the other elements to the least restrictive class: `logical` --> `integer` --> `numeric` --> `character`
:::


```{r}
chr_vec <- c("hello", "goodbye", "see you later"); class(chr_vec)
numeric_vec <- c(5, 1.3, 10); class(numeric_vec)
logical_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE); class(logical_vec)

### use c() to combine different types; what's the result?
combined_vec <- c(TRUE, 3.14, "puppies!"); class(combined_vec)
combined_vec ### look, all elements are character (in quotes)
```

---

[Data structures in R: vectors]{.slide-title}

:::{.body-text}
You can set or retrieve a value of an element in a vector using that element's "index" or position.

A set of single square brackets `[...]` is used to select an element or set of elements for vectors.
:::


```{r}
numeric_vec <- c(5, 1.3, 10, 2.8, 17, -1)

numeric_vec[2]          ### retrieve the second element
numeric_vec[3:5]        ### retrieve the third through fifth element
numeric_vec[c(1, 3, 6)] ### use a vector to retrieve elements

numeric_vec[2] <- 3.14  ### set the value of the second element
numeric_vec             ### element 2 has been changed
```

---

[Data structures in R: matrix and array]{.slide-title}

::: {.body-text}
Matrices and arrays are like vectors, but two-dimensional and N-dimensional, respectively.
:::

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}

![](images/data_structures_matrix_array.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="50%"}

::::: {.body-text}
* A **vector** has only one dimension (length)
* A **matrix** has two dimensions (rows/columns).
* An **array** has more than two dimensions (e.g., a cube, but can also contain as many dimensions as you need)

:::::

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

::: {.body-text}
Like a vector, all elements of a matrix or array must be of the same type.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
Matrices and arrays are useful for mathematical purposes, e.g., linear algebra, but not as commonly used for data science purposes.
:::

---

[Data structures in R: lists]{.slide-title}

A **list** contains one or more elements, but *unlike* a vector, each element can be a different type.

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/data_structures_list.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="60%"}

::::: {.body-text}
We can create a list using the `list()` function.
:::::

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

```{r}
### a list containing three numeric elements:
list_of_nums <- list(5, 3.14, -999)

### a list containing elements of different types
list_of_stuff <- list(5, 7:10, c("puppies", "kittens"), c(TRUE, FALSE))
list_of_stuff[[2]]
```

---

[Data structures in R: lists]{.slide-title}

:::{.body-text}
Like a vector, you can set or retrieve a value of an element in a **list** using that element's "index" or position.

A set of **double** square brackets `[[...]]` is used to select an element or set of elements for lists.
:::

```{r}
### a list containing elements of different types
list_of_stuff <- list(5, 7:10, c("puppies", "kittens"), c(TRUE, FALSE))

class(list_of_stuff[[2]]) ### numeric vector: 7, 8, 9, 10
class(list_of_stuff[[3]]) ### character vector: "puppies" and "kittens"

list_of_stuff[[1]] <- list("bananas", c(1, 2, 4))
class(list_of_stuff[[1]]) ### was numeric, now it's a list!
```

---

[Data structures in R: data frames]{.slide-title}

A **data frame** is a two-dimensional structure for tabular data, with columns that can differ in type.

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/data_structures_dataframe.png){width=100%}
:::: 
<!-- end left column -->

:::: {.column width="60%"}

::::: {.body-text}

You can create one with `data.frame()`, but in practice most data frames come from importing spreadsheets such as `.xlsx` files or comma-separated `.csv` files.

:::::

:::: 
<!-- end right column -->

::: 
<!-- end .columns -->

---

[Data structures in R: data frames]{.slide-title}

:::{.body-text}

Data frames consist of named **columns**, each storing a variable, and **rows** that hold the observed values for those variables.

Let's create a simple one representing three dogs, with ages (in human years) and weights (in pounds).
:::

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="65%"}
Create the data frame:
```{r}
dog_df <- data.frame(
    name   = c('Waffle', 'Khora', 'Teddy'),
    weight = c(      35,      60,     50),
    age    = c(       5,       9,      7)
  )
```

::::

:::: {.column width="35%"}
Result:
```{r}
dog_df
```
::::

:::

:::{.callout-note}

## Code styling

::::{.body-text}
Note that spacing, tabs, and new lines don't affect how the R code runs - but they can help make it easier to read! Use code styling to help communicate your intentions to others.
::::

:::

---

[Data structures in R: data frames]{.slide-title}

We can explore our data frame using the RStudio IDE.

:::{.body-text}
Try these out to see how they work:
  
* Find the `dog_df` data frame in the **Environment** pane and click on it
    * Interactive view, try sorting and searching!
* Find the data frame in the **Environment** pane and click on the blue arrow next to it
* In the **Console**, type `head(dog_df)` to see the first few rows
    * Note, our data frame is very short so you'll see all the rows!
* In the **Console**, type `View(dog_df)` (note capital V) 
    * This is the same as clicking on it in the **Environment** pane.
:::

[Data structures in R: data frames]{.slide-title}

:::{.callout-note}

## A data frame is just a named list of vectors!

::::{.body-text}
To help understand how to access information in a data frame, it is helpful to look at it as a **list** of **vectors**, each vector of the same length, and given a handy name!
::::
:::

```{r}
dog_df <- data.frame(
    name   = c('Waffle', 'Khora', 'Teddy'), ### char vec length 3
    weight = c(      35,      60,     50),  ### num vec length 3
    age    = c(       5,       9,      7)   ### num vec length 3
  )
```

:::{.body-text}
Because a data frame is a list of vectors, our single `[...]` and double `[[...]]` square brackets can work, but there are other more elegant ways of retrieving and setting values in a data frame.
:::

---

[Data structures in R: data frames]{.slide-title}

Accessing elements of a data frame

:::{.body-text}

You can extract elements from a data frame with two-dimensional indexing: `df[rows, columns]`. Entire columns can be pulled by name using `df[['col']]` or `df$col`. To access specific elements within a column, index the column directly, for example `df$col[3]`.
    
:::

---

[Data structures in R: data frames]{.slide-title}

Accessing values of elements of a data frame
    
:::{.body-text}
Using the `dog_df` we created previously:
:::

```{r}
dog_df[1, 3]       ### first row, third column: Waffle's age

### leave row or column blank to choose all in that row/col:
dog_df[ , 1]       ### all rows, first column: name of all dogs 

dog_df[['weight']] ### weight of all dogs, in order
dog_df$age         ### age of all dogs, in order
dog_df$name[2]     ### name of all dogs, then choose only element 2
```

---

[Data structures in R: data frames]{.slide-title}

**Changing** values of elements of a data frame or **adding** new variables
    
:::{.body-text}
Using the `dog_df` we created previously, let's update Waffle's age and weight, and then add a new column describing the color of each dog.
:::

```{r}
dog_df[1, 2] <- 34  ### assign new value to row 1, col 2
dog_df$age[1] <- 6  ### assign new value to age[1]

### create a new column using the $ operator, and assign values
dog_df$color <- c('tan', 'grey', 'brown') 

dog_df  ### inspect the updated data frame
```

---

[Data structures in R: data frames]{.slide-title}

Accessing elements of a data frame

::: {.callout-note}
::::{.columns}
:::::{.column width="15%"}
![](images/tidyverse_hex.jpg){width=100%}
:::::

:::::{.column width="85%"}
:::::{.body-text}

These methods of accessing data within a dataframe will **always** work in R, as they are part of **Base R**, or the core functionality of the R language.  

Later we will introduce you to a different approach to coding in R, called the **Tidyverse**, that you may find easier and more elegant.
