Huge thanks to [Julie Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io/) for writing most of this content and letting us build on her material, which in turn was built on [Jenny Bryan's](https://jennybryan.org/about/) materials. We highly recommend reading through the original lessons and using them as reference (see in the resources section below).\n:::\n\n## Welcome to R Programming\n\n![Artwork by Allison Horst](images/r_programming_introduction/allison-horst-code-kitchen.png)\n\nIncorporating programming into analysis workflows makes science more efficient and more computationally reproducible. We will use the programming language R, and the accompanying integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio. R is a great language to learn for data-oriented programming because it is widely adopted, user-friendly, and (most importantly) open source.\n\n### What is the difference between R and RStudio?\n\nImagine you are a chef, and you have to prepare a meal. You'll need a place to work (a kitchen), you'll need some tools (pots, pans, a knife, etc.), and you'll need some ingredients. In this analogy, **R is a good chef's knife** - one of the most important tools that you'll use to accomplish your task.\n\nAnd **if R is your chef's knife, RStudio is your kitchen**. RStudio provides a place to do your work! RStudio makes working with R easier by bringing together other tools for working efficiently - like a file browser, data viewer, help pages, terminal, support, etc. You could learn R without RStudio,\n\n(and in this analogy, your ingredients are **data**!)\n\n::: callout-warning\n### R without RStudio?\n\nJust as you can prepare food without a kitchen, we could learn R without RStudio. RStudio makes it much easier to work with R, just as a well-stocked kitchen makes cooking more fun. We are going to take advantage of the great RStudio support, and learn R and RStudio in conjunction.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n### New to coding? New to R? No worries!\n\nLearning R is like learning any new language. It's an ongoing process, it takes time, you'll make mistakes, it can be frustrating, but it will be overwhelmingly useful in the long run. We all speak at least one language - no matter how fluent you are, you'll always be learning, you'll be trying things in new contexts, learning new words and new phrases.\n\nYou'll learn to understand context for programming language just like you learn the context for spoken language. Think about how every language often has a word for the first meal of the day -- *breakfast* in English, *desayuno* in Spanish. Programming languages also have words (functions) that express specific ideas. There is a way to sort values, search for text patterns, calculate medians, or reshape data. The goal is to expand your expectations so that each goal that you have, there's likely a function that helps you get there.\n:::\n\n## Using R within the RStudio IDE\n\nLet's take a tour of the RStudio interface.\n\n[Full Screen](slides/r_programming_introduction/slides1_coding_in_console.html)\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/r_programming_introduction/slides1_coding_in_console.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n### Objects in R\n\nLet's say the value of 12 that we got from running `3 * 4` is a really important value we need to keep. To store information in R, we need to create an **object**.\n\nWe can assign a value or expression to an object using the assignment operator, `<-` (greater than sign and minus sign). All objects in R are created using the assignment operator, following this form: `object_name <- value`.\n\n:::: callout-exercise\n**Create an object!**\n\nAssign your favorite number to an object called `fave_num`. Then, create an object called `fave_squared` and assign the square of `fave_num` (use the superscript, like `5^2`), and inspect the object.\n\n::: callout-answer\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### think of this code as someone saying \"fave_num gets 42\".\nfave_num <- 42\n\n### and then square it\nfave_squared <- fave_num^2\nfave_squared\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1764\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice how after creating the `fave_num` object, R doesn't print anything. However, we know our code worked because we see the object, and the value we wanted to store is now visible in our **Global Environment**. We can force R to print the value of the object by calling the object name (aka typing it out) or by using parentheses.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### printing the object by calling the object name\nfave_squared\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1764\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### printing the object by wrapping the assignment syntax in parentheses\n(fave_squared <- fave_num^2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1764\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Quick navigation in the console\n\nWhen you begin typing, RStudio will suggest autocompletions that you can select by hitting `tab`, then `return`.\n\nIn the Console, use the up and down arrow keys to call your command history, which shows the most recent commands first.\n:::\n\n### Naming Things\n\nWhen naming objects, variables, observations, or data frames, make them:\n\n1.  **Meaningful**\n    -   Pick names that are specific to the data, experiment, or project. Their interpretation should be *intuitive* - they shouldn't be so generic or vague that the user needs a glossary to know what they contain.\n\n    -   **Bad Examples**: File-1.xlsx, indicator1, indicator2, ExperimentA.R, ExperimentB.R\n\n    -   **Better Examples:** taco_nutrients.csv, nc_demographics, mice_1a_mass, rachel_carson_spatial.shp\n2.  **Consistent**\n    -   Keep names **perfectly identical** for identical value entries (e.g. \"burrito-32\" and \"Burrito 32\" are completely different things to R)\n\n    -   Be consistent **across data frames.** Your life will be easier if you have year called \"year\" in both sets, instead of \"Year\" and \"YEAR\" and \"Year_New\".\n\n    -   Use logical suffixes (if necessary), consistently formatted. Like: temp_water_surface, temp_water_sub, temp_water_bottom\n3.  **Concise**\n    -   Balance meaningfulness with conciseness\n\n    -   Better to be descriptive than not know what a variable is (especially with tab completion)\n\n    -   Longer names = tedious coding, but less effort to look through metadata for column/identifier names (or risk of mis-remembering...)\n\n    -   **Bad examples:** 'first dive temp readings Celsius', greatblueheron_observations_2019_09_20, \"Cori final figures version 3.xlsx\"\n\n    -   **Better examples:** beaufort_sst, UsTotalPop, PercCover\n4.  **Code and coder-friendly**\n    -   Avoid punctuation (%, !, \\~, (, ), #) in names - more challenging to type and can mean things in code that you don't want it to (or break it)\n\n    -   Avoid spaces (makes coding much more difficult)\n\n    -   Avoid starting object names with numbers (but could be useful for file names in sequence)\n\n    -   Pick and be consistent with a choice of case\n\n#### Case conventions\n\nA clear, consistent [naming convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming%2C%20a%20naming,in%20source%20code%20and%20documentation) improves readability and reduces cognitive load. Choosing one is a personal preference.\n\nFor the object `fave_num`, we used an underscore to separate the object name. This naming convention is called **lowercase snake case** - it is common in data science because it's easy to scan, works well across operating systems, and avoids ambiguity.\n\n-   `snake_case`\n-   `camelCase` is compact but less readable\n-   `UpperCamelCase` (also called `PascalCase`) sometimes signals a different kind of object\n-   `kebab-case` is not good for object names because R treats a hyphen (`-`) as a minus sign\n\n## Running code in an R Script\n\nWe've been typing code in the Console, let's try running code in an R Script. A script is a plain text file that RStudio uses by sending the selected lines to the Console, just as if you had typed them yourself.\n\n[Full Screen](slides/r_programming_introduction/slides2_coding_in_script.html)\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/r_programming_introduction/slides2_coding_in_script.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n:::: callout-exercise\n**Create a vector!**\n\nCreate a vector with the values 18.1, 8.9, 11.3, 11.2, and 15.7, representing tree heights in meters, and assign it an appropriate name. Convert these heights to feet (1 meter = 3.28 feet) and store the result in a second object. \n\nAs a bonus, calculate the average tree height. Hint: look at the `mean` function! Typing `?mean` in the console will show you the help page for this function.e\n\n::: callout-answer\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Height of trees in meters\ntree_h_m <- c(18.1, 8.9, 11.3, 11.2, 15.7)\n\nm_to_ft <- 3.28  ### meters to feet conversion ratio\n\n### Height of trees in feet\ntree_h_ft <- tree_h_m * m_to_ft\n\n### Mean height of trees, in feet\nmean(tree_h_ft)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 42.7712\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n## Data types and structures in R\n\nWe've been using `numeric` data types, but R also works with text. Creating a `character` object requires quotes: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nscience_rocks <- \"yes it does!\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: callout-exercise\nTry running the following lines in your script or console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"Hello world!\" * 5\n\n\"7\" * 5\n\n7 * 5\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhat happened? What do you see in the Console? \n\n:::\n\nThese examples show how R treats different data types. Only the numeric expression produces a calculation. Character strings can’t be multiplied because their operations differ from those defined for numbers.\n\nEvery object in R has a class, and valid operations depend on that class. Numbers support arithmetic; strings support text manipulation, which you can extend with packages such as [`stringr`](http://stringr.tidyverse.org/) and [`tidytext`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) packages.\n\n\n[Full Screen](slides/r_programming_introduction/slides3_data_structures.html)\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/r_programming_introduction/slides3_data_structures.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n:::: callout-exercise\n## Accessing data in a data frame\n\nWorking with data frames is an important skill for data science in R. There are some built-in datasets in R, including sample data frames that we can work with. Let's access the built-in `mtcars` data frame, a set of attributes of various cars from Motor Trends 1974.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(mtcars) ### loads a built-in dataset\nhead(mtcars) ### look at the first few rows\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFigure out at least 3 ways to access the horsepower `hp` of a Datsun 710.\n\n::: callout-answer\nHere are a few ways that would work:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|eval: false\n### choose the 3rd row, 4th column:\nmtcars[3, 4]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Put the hp column into a vector, then choose\n### the 3rd element of the vector (3 ways):\nx <- mtcars$hp\nx[3]           \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- mtcars[['hp']]\ny[3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nz <- mtcars[ , 4]\nz[3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### note, you can chain these:\nmtcars$hp[3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Similarly, select just the Datsun 710 row (3),\n### then choose the hp out of that\nx <- mtcars[3, ]\nx$hp\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Use row names and column names:\nmtcars['Datsun 710', 'hp']\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 93\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe'll learn more ways later, with the powerful and popular `tidyverse` package. Note that choosing by row number and column number is a little risky - what if someone reorders the rows or columns and doesn't tell you? So choosing by name where possible, or filtering using logical tests, is generally preferable!\n:::\n::::\n\n## R Functions\n\nIn R, an **object** is a **noun** while a **function** is a **verb** - functions do all our data science work for us.\n\n[Full Screen](slides/r_programming_introduction/slides4_functions.html)\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"slides/r_programming_introduction/slides4_functions.html\" style=\"border: 1px solid #2e3846;\"></iframe>\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nCreate a vector to store the noon temperature (in Celsius) in Beaufort for three consecutive summer days:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemp_c <- c(27, 29, 31)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::: callout-exercise\n**Use the `mean()` function to calculate the mean temperature**\n\nUse the Help page for `mean()` (`?mean`) to see what the function expects: it computes the mean of a numeric vector, and its only required argument is x. Using it here:\n\n::: callout-answer\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x = temp_c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 29\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n::::: callout-exercise\n**Save the mean to an object called `mean_temp_c`**\n\n::: callout-answer\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### saving the mean using the assignment operator `<-`\nmean_temp_c <- mean(x = temp_c)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n:::: callout-exercise\nEarlier, we created a vector of tree heights in meters (`tree_h_m`). Use mean() again and store it in a new object called `mean_h_m`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean_height_m <- mean(tree_h_m)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter ten years, each tree has grown 3 meters. Update the vector:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_h_m <- tree_h_m + 3 ### note, this adds 3 to each element!\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, call `mean_height_m` in the console or take a look at your Global Environment. Is that the value you expected? Why or why not?\n\n::: callout-answer\n\nCalling `mean_h_m` now shows the original value. Object assignment in R is independent: updating     `tree_h_m` does not update `mean_h_m` unless you recalculate it. \n:::\n::::\n\nThis provides an important concept: **R scripts run from top to bottom**. When editing a script, values depend on the order in which the lines are executed. Clearing the environment and running the script from start to finish is the best way to ensure the results reflect the full sequence of code.\n\n\n## Reading and working with data frames\n\n### Use the `read.csv()` function to read a file into R\n\nWe’ve assigned values to objects and used functions, but now we’ll bring in real data. `read.csv()` is a function that does exactly what it promises: it reads a CSV file into R. \n\nSince this is our first time using it, start with the Help page (`?read.csv`). It’s long because the function has many optional arguments, but the key one is the first: you need to tell R which file to read. Let's get a file!\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Download a file from the Arctic Data Center\n\n1)  Navigate to this dataset by Craig Tweedie that is published on the Arctic Data Center. [Craig Tweedie. 2009. North Pole Environmental Observatory Bottle Chemistry. Arctic Data Center. doi:10.18739/A25T3FZ8X.](http://doi.org/10.18739/A25T3FZ8X)\n2)  Download `BGchem2008data.csv` by clicking the \"download\" button next to the file (cloud + arrow). Save it in a folder called `data` in the project.\n3)  Confirm the file is in `data` by checking the **Files** pane.\n\n:::\n\nNow tell `read.csv()` where to find the file. The `Help` page shows the `file` argument, which takes a path.  In R, you can either use absolute paths (which will start with your home directory `~/`) or paths **relative to your current working directory.** RStudio has some great auto-complete capabilities when using relative paths, so we will go that route.\n\nIf your working directory is your project (`training_{NAME}`) and the CSV is in `data`, your import looks like this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# reading in data using relative paths\nbg_chem_dat <- read.csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis creates a data frame called `bg_chem_dat`. Check that it loaded by looking in the environment pane.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Optional Arguments\n\nThe Help page for `read.csv()` lists many arguments we didn’t use. Some are optional; some are required. Optional arguments appear as `name = value`, where the value shown is the default. If you don’t specify that argument, the function uses the default. For `read.csv()`, `header = TRUE` is a typical example.\n\nRequired arguments appear without a value. For `read.csv()`, the only **required** argument is `file`.\n\n:::\n\nR can match arguments by name or by position. In our earlier call, we didn’t specify `file =` because `file` is the first argument, and R assigns the first value to it automatically. The equivalent explicit call would be:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbg_chem_dat <- read.csv(file = \"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo adjust another argument, we need to name it, because the second argument in `read.csv()` is `header`. For example, many people set `stringsAsFactors` like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# relative file path\nbg_chem_dat <- read.csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Quick Tip\n\nWith familiar functions, it’s common to omit names for the first one or two arguments. For less familiar functions, naming every argument makes your code more readable for collaborators and your future self.\n\n:::\n\n### Working with data frames in R\n\nA `data.frame` stores tabular data: columns represent variables, and rows represent observations. When you used `read.csv()`, the result was a `data.frame` saved as `bg_chem_dat`. Explore it a few ways:\n\n-   Click on `bg_chem_dat` in the environment pane\n-   Click on the arrow next to `bg_chem_dat` in the environment pane\n-   Run `head(bg_chem_dat)` in the Console\n-   Run `View(bg_chem_dat)` in the Console\n\nNow examine specific columns and try a few simple calculations:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(bg_chem_dat$Date)\n\nmean_temp <- mean(bg_chem_dat$CTD_Temperature)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Other ways to load tablular data\n\nBase R’s `read.csv()` is common, but many workflows use other import functions that also produce data frames:\n\n1. `readr::read_csv()` from the handles csv files quickly and parses types (including dates) more reliably. (try: `bg_chem_dat <- readr::read_csv(\"data/BGchem2008data.csv\")`)\n2. `readxl::read_excel()` reads Excel files.\n3. `googlesheets4::read_sheet()` reads directly from Google Sheets.\n\n:::\n\n## Logical operators and expressions\n\nWe can ask questions about an object using **logical operators and expressions**. Let's ask some \"questions\" about the `tree_h_m` object we made.\n\n-   `==` means 'is equal to'\n-   `!=` means 'is not equal to'\n-   `<` means 'is less than'\n-   `>` means 'is greater than'\n-   `<=` means 'is less than or equal to'\n-   `>=` means 'is greater than or equal to'\n\nR will apply the logical test to each element of a vector and tell you the result as TRUE or FALSE.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# examples using logical operators and expressions\ntree_h_m == 8.9\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_h_m >= 14\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntree_h_m != 11.3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Error messages are your friends\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/r_programming_introduction/practicalDev_googleErrorMessage.jpg){width=\"100%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\nProgramming comes with an implicit contract: the computer handles the tedious work, and you provide precise instructions. Typos and capitalization matter, and small differences can change the meaning entirely. Treat R as a language... misunderstandings will happen.\n\nWhen R can’t interpret what you’ve written, you’ll get an error. Some errors are straightforward, essentially asking “What?” or pointing to exactly where the problem is. Others are less helpful. Either way, they’re part of the process and a normal part of learning to communicate clearly with the computer.\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n\nError messages are a learning opportunity. Copy and paste them into Google (or ChatGPT) to see what they mean. Note that knowing how to Google is a skill and takes practice. This [Masters of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) (MEDS) program workshop [Teach Me How to Google](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/teach-me-how-to-google/#1) has a very helpful guide.\n\nSome mistakes don't trigger errors right away. R may understand what you wrote, but not what you intended... much like talking about \"tables\" and realizing too late that the listener was picturing furniture instead of data. These misunderstandings accumulate and make later results confusing.  Writing clear code and checking your work step by step helps prevent these silent errors and keeps your analysis on track.\n\n## R Packages\n\n![Artwork by Allison Horst](images/r_programming_introduction/allison-horst-r-doorway.png){width=\"80%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nR packages are the building blocks of computational reproducibility in R. Each package contains a set of related functions that enable you to more easily do a task or set of tasks in R. There are thousands of community-maintained packages out there for just about every imaginable use of R - including many that you have probably never thought of!\n\nTo install a package, we use the syntax `install.packages(\"packge_name\")`. A package only needs to be installed once, so this code can be run directly in the console if needed. Generally, you don't want to save your install package calls in a script, because when you run the script it will re-install the package, which you only need to do once, or if you need to update the package.\n\n## R Resources\n\n+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Learning R Resources | -

The Workspace is where user-defined objects accumulate. There are a few useful commands for getting information about your Environment, which make it easier for you to reference your objects when your Environment gets filled with many, many objects.\n\n![](images/r_programming_introduction/RStudio_IDE_env.png)\n\nYou can get a listing of these objects with a couple of different R functions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobjects()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"fave_num\"      \"fave_squared\"  \"m_to_ft\"       \"mean_height_m\"\n [5] \"mean_temp_c\"   \"mtcars\"        \"science_rocks\" \"temp_c\"       \n [9] \"tree_h_ft\"     \"tree_h_m\"      \"x\"             \"y\"            \n[13] \"z\"            \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nls()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"fave_num\"      \"fave_squared\"  \"m_to_ft\"       \"mean_height_m\"\n [5] \"mean_temp_c\"   \"mtcars\"        \"science_rocks\" \"temp_c\"       \n [9] \"tree_h_ft\"     \"tree_h_m\"      \"x\"             \"y\"            \n[13] \"z\"            \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to remove the object named `tree_h_m`, you can do this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(tree_h_m)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo remove everything (or click the Broom icon in the Environment pane):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrm(list = ls())\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {,callout-tip}\n#### Quick Tip\n\nIt's good practice to clear your environment. Over time your Global Environmental will fill up with many objects, and this can result in unexpected errors or objects being overridden with unexpected values. Also it's difficult to read / reference your environment when it's cluttered!\n:::\n\n## Save Workspace Image to .RData?\n\n![](images/r_programming_introduction/save-workspace.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n**DON'T SAVE**\n\nWhen ever you close or switch projects you will be promped with the question: Do you want to save your workspace image to /\"current-project\"/ .RData?\n\nRStudio by default wants to save the state of your environment (the objects you have in your environment pane) into the RData file so that when you open the project again you have the same environment. However, as we discussed above, it is good practice to constantly clear and clean your environment. It is generally **NOT** a good practice to rely on the state of your environment for your script to run and work. If you are coding reproducibly, your code should be able to reproduce the state of your environment (all the necessary objects) every time you run it. It is much better to rely on your code recreating the environment than saving the workspace status.\n\nTo make sure you're always working reproducibly, change the Global Options configuration for the default to be NEVER SAVE MY WORKSPACE. Go to Tools \\> Global Options. Under the General menu, select Never next to \"Save workspace to .RData on exit\" (and uncheck \"Restore .RData into workspace at startup\"). This way you won't get asked every time you close a project, instead RStudio knows not to save.\n\n![](images/r_programming_introduction/save-workspace-global-options.png) :::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n",
