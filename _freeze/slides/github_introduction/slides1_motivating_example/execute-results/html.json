More information [here](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-the-RStudio-IDE).\n:::\n\n---\n\n:::{.body-text}\nYou're not entirely sure what she means but you figure there's only one thing she could be talking about: more cowbell. So you add it to the model in order to really explore the space.\n\nBut you're worried about losing track of the old model so, instead of editing the code in place, you comment out the old code and put as serious a warning as you can muster in a comment above it.\n\n![](images/git-intro-slide03.png)\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n\n\n:::{.body-text}\nCommenting out code you don't want to lose is something probably all of us have done at one point or another but it's really hard to understand why you did this when you come back years later or you when you send your script to a colleague. Luckily, there's a better way: Version control. Instead of commenting out the old code, we can change the code in place and tell Git to commit our change. So now we have two distinct versions of our analysis and we can always see what the previous version(s) look like.\n\n![](images/github_introduction/git-intro-slide04.png)\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n##  {#rstudio-files data-menu-title=\"RStudio Files\"}\n\n[RStudio IDE interface]{.slide-title}\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n:::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n![](images/rstudio_ide_files.png){width=100%}\n:::: \n<!-- end left column -->\n\n:::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n::::: {.body-text}\n\nThe **Files pane** displays files and folders where you might store R scripts, datasets, images, etc.\n\nYou can navigate around these files just like you would normally browse on your computer, and open scripts, inspect data, etc.\n:::::\n\n:::: \n<!-- end right column -->\n\n::: \n<!-- end .columns -->\n\n:::{.body-text}\nNote the other tabs: when you create plots, this pane will switch to that tab and show you the plots.  You can see what packages (and versions) you have installed, get help on functions and packages, and view HTML or other outputs on these tabs.\n:::\n\n---\n\n[Coding in the Console]{.slide-title}\n\n:::{.body-text}\nWe can run code in the Console window - direct access to the R application.  Let's start there, but later we'll generally not do much in the console, but instead in scripts.\n\nAt its most basic, we can use R as a calculator.  Let's try a couple of examples in the console.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 * 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 12\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 + 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 7\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 - 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n3 / 4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.75\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.body-text}\nNotice when you hit \"enter\" after the calculation, R immediately evaluates the calculation for you and tells you the result.\n:::\n\n---\n\n[Coding in the Console]{.slide-title}\n\n<hr>\n\n::: {.callout-caution icon=\"false\"}\n#### Quick Tip\n\nWhen you're in the console you'll see a greater than sign (`>`) at the start of a line. This is called the \"prompt\" and when we see it, it means R is ready to accept commands. If you see a plus sign (`+`) in the Console, it means R is waiting on additional information before running. You can always press escape (`esc`) to return to the prompt. Try practicing this by running `3*` (or any incomplete expression) in the console.\n:::\n\n---\n\n## {#example-code-slide data-menu-title=\"Example Code\"}\n\n[Storing values in objects]{.slide-title}\n\n<hr>\n\n::: {.body-text}\nWe can assign the value of some calculation to an \"object\" by giving it a name.\nFor example, we can store the result of the calculation `3 * 4` and call it \"result\".\nThen we can call the name of the object to retrieve the value.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresult <- 3 * 4   ### assign the value\n\nresult            ### retrieve the value\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 12\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.body-text}\nTechnically, we are creating an object called \"result\" and assigning the value to that object.  Then we can call the *name* of the object to use the *value* in other calculations, and so on.\n:::\n\n---\n\n[Storing values in objects]{.slide-title}\n\n<hr>\n\n::: {.body-text}\nHere's a slightly more complicated example to calculate the volume of a cylinder.\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nr <- 5            ### radius of cylinder is 5 units\narea <- pi * r^2  ### calculate the area, using r\n\narea              ### report the area\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 78.53982\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nh <- 7            ### height of cylinder is 7 units\nvol <- area * h   ### volume is area X height\n\nvol               ### report the volume\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 549.7787\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n##  {#rstudio-envir2 data-menu-title=\"RStudio Environment2\"}\n\n[RStudio IDE interface]{.slide-title}\n\n::: {.columns}\n\n:::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n![](images/rstudio_ide_envir2.png){width=100%}\n:::: \n<!-- end left column -->\n\n:::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n::::: {.body-text}\n\nCheck the **Environment pane** again - it no longer says \"Environment is empty\" but instead contains the objects and values we created in our example.\n:::::\n\n:::: \n<!-- end right column -->\n\n::: \n<!-- end .columns -->\n\n---\n\n[R scripts vs. console]{.slide-title}\n\n<hr>\n\n::: {.body-text}\nWhile there are many cases where it makes sense to type code directly in to the the console, it is not a great place to write most of your code since you can't save what you ran. \n:::\n\n**A better way is to create an R Script, and write your code there.** \n\n::: {.body-text}\nThen when you run your code from the script, you can save it when you are done, and you can re-run it later to get the exact same result - a key to  **reproducible science**. We're going to work some more example code in the Console for now, but we'll code in an R Script later in this lesson.\n:::\n\n\n",
