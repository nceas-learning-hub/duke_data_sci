## Why Should I Join?

By popular request, I’m going to lead a series of workshops about working with data. These are based on stellar training materials developed by the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), who are arguably the experts at teaching this stuff. We will cover practical ways to make life easier for Future You and keep projects (mostly) under control. 

This is an immersion series in R programming for environmental data science, focusing on how to leverage data science tools to:

-   increase your capacity to **collaborate with your team,**
-   create **reproducible workflows,**
-   and learn **best practices for open science.**

<!-- ::: callout-tip -->
<!-- ### Learning Objectives -->

<!-- -   Effectively manage data using `tidy` data practices -->
<!-- -   Implement reproducible scientific workflows throughout all aspects of a project -->
<!-- -   Establish best practices and utilize tools like Git & GitHub to optimize your collaboration -->
<!-- -   Better communicate scientific analyses and results using Markdown, GitHub webpages, and R packages like `ggplot2` and `Shiny` -->
<!-- -   Increase your familiarity and confidence with data science tools -->

## NCEAS Expertise

The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals. We are excited to pass along skills, workflows, mindsets learn throughout the years.
