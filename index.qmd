## Why Should I Join?

By popular request, I’m going to lead a series of workshops about working with data. We will cover practical ways to make life easier for Future You and keep projects (mostly) under control, including key collaboration tools and best practices for using R for ecological data analyses.

The first session will be Friday Nov. 7th, 1 - 2:30 pm (DUML & Zoom). We’ll cover:
1) Benefits of reproducible workflows
2) Best practices for file structure and organization
3) Intro to Git & GitHub

We’ll also decide together what future topics would be most helpful. These will build on the essentials from this first session, so please attend this one if you’re at all interested in the series.

## NCEAS Expertise

The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals. We are excited to pass along skills, workflows, mindsets learn throughout the years.
